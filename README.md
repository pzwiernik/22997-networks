  This course offers an introduction to the mathematics of networks, their dynamics, and their applications in economics and the social sciences. We combine rigorous probabilistic models with real-world data and case studies, moving from the basics of Erdős–Rényi random graphs to power laws, small-world phenomena, clustering, and preferential attachment.
